This is my implementaion of traveling salesman problem. I aproached it using genetic algoritam, using roullete selection, and changig mutation in simulated anealing manner.


I found a lot about this problem on this blog http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5 
They also use this same combination of nodes

The best result I got 753.39(http://prntscr.com/h501ih)
I used this on these cordinates, and meassured the distance with euclidic formula

(60, 200)
(180, 200)
(80, 180)
(140, 180)
(20, 160)
(100, 160)
(200, 160)
(140, 140)
(40, 120)
(100, 120)
(180, 100)
(60, 80)
(120, 80)
(180, 60)
(20, 40)
(100, 40)
(200, 40)
(20, 20)
(60, 20)
(160, 20)

If you have any questions feal free to contact me, and as far as I am concerned use any of my code in any way you can!
Cheers!
